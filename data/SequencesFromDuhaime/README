This directory holds fasta sequences and a figure of the interactions between some environmental phages that Melissa Duhaime tested against each other. 

The blue sections of the heatmap show positive interactions (confirmed infections) and the yellow show negative interactions (confirmed lack of interactions).

I got these files from Melissa and added them into my validation dataset.
