## Abstract

Viruses and bacteria are critical components of the human microbiome and play important roles in health and disease. Most previous work has relied on studying bacteria and phages in isolation, reducing them to two separate communities. Such approaches are not able to capture how these communities interact to maintain stability and share information (i.e. horizontal gene transfer). We developed and implemented a network-based analytical approach to provide an initial understanding of phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the human body. We accomplished this by building a machine learning algorithm to predict which phages infected which bacteria in a given microbiome. This algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts. We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We found that gut and skin network structures were person-specific, and were not conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets and obesity were associated with less connected networks. There were significant differences in network structure between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being less connected and more prone to instability. Together this study characterized the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for future studies to investigate the role of ecological networks in conditions such as disease states.
