#Project Progress

##Completed Tasks
* All interaction prediction methods are completed other than Uniprot.
* Graph database construction workflow is functional without noticable bugs (knock on wood).
* Basic graph analysis workflows established to act as foundation moving forward.

##Current Tasks
* Fixing bacteria-phage interaction prediction by Uniprot on Flux.
* Creating strategy for analysis and manuscript. I think an interesting approach will be using the clusters of interacting bacteria/phages for defining community classes ("enterotypes"). This could be especially good for bacterial analysis and compared to previous classfiications by co-abundance. I am starting by following the model of Ding & Schloss.
* Establishing protocol for evaluating/validating accuracy of predicted interactions.
