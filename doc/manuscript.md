#### Construction & Validation of Bacteria-Phage Interaction Network
We used Neo4J graph database software to construct the network of predicted interactions between bacteria and bacteriophages. Results from a variety of complementary interaction prediction approaches were layered into a single network **(Figure 1)**. *In vitro*, experimentally validated interactive relationships were taken from the existing literature. Clustered Regularily Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) are a sort of bacterial adaptive immune system that serves as a genomic record of phage infections by preserving genomic content from the infectious phage genome. These records were used to predict infectious relationships between bacteria and phages. Infectious relationships were also predicted by identifying expected protien-protien interactions and known interacting protein domains between phages and their bacterial hosts. We finally used nucleotide blast to identify genomic similarity between bacteriophage genomes and sections of bacterial genomes. Such a match is a good predictor of an interaction between the phage and it's bacterial host.
