##Outline Ideas

1. Database Construction
2. Benchmarking and Confidence
3. Gut Virome Host Ranges and Clusters
4. Associations with IBD (Virgin Dataset)
5. Associations with Antibiotics (Modi Dataset)
6. Predicting host preferences, future evolution, and future interactions (social network approach)
7. Functionally Attempt Spiking Mouse Microbiome with Predicted Impactful Phgaes (ATCC Focus)

##Predictive Models
There are different ways graph databases can be used for predictive modeling and classificaiton.

1. Use database features as features within the predictive model (e.g. edges on the node, shortest paths)
2. Implement triadic closure theory in the model
2. Classification algorithms by edge clustering
